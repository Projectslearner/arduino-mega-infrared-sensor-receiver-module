# Infrared Sensor Receiver Module

#### Project Overview

The Infrared Sensor Receiver Module project demonstrates how to interface an IR receiver module with an Arduino Mega to detect infrared signals. IR receiver modules typically output a digital signal that changes state when they receive modulated infrared light signals. This project reads the state of the IR receiver pin and prints the result to the Serial Monitor, indicating whether an IR signal is detected or not.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Mega**
- **Infrared (IR) Receiver Module**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the IR Receiver Module to Arduino Mega:**
   - **Signal Pin** of the IR receiver module to digital pin 2 (`irReceiverPin`) on Arduino Mega
   - **VCC** of the IR receiver module to **5V** on Arduino Mega
   - **GND** of the IR receiver module to **GND** on Arduino Mega

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the IR receiver module to the Arduino Mega as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.
   - Open the serial monitor in Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud).
   - Observe the Serial Monitor for messages indicating the state of the IR receiver module and IR signal detection.

#### Applications

- **Remote Control Systems:** Integrate into projects that involve remote control functionality using IR signals.
- **Object Detection:** Use in projects requiring detection of IR signals from proximity sensors or other IR-emitting devices.
- **Automation:** Implement in automation systems for triggering actions based on IR signal reception.

#### Notes

- Ensure the IR receiver module is positioned correctly to receive IR signals effectively.
- Adjust the delay time in the `loop()` function to control the frequency of sensor readings based on your project requirements.
- Use appropriate modulation schemes and protocols if interfacing with specific IR transmitters.
